												<p>What would you say if I told you that you could be rich in mind and soul before earning financial wealth? That people achieve this feat everyday without ever realizing it. What about the fact that it is easier than you think to sharpen your mind to rival the likes of like Leonardo Da Vinci, Albert Einstein, Sir Isaac Newton, or Benjamin Franklin? If you think it sounds too good to be true, you are wrong. Listed below are some quick notes of worthy brainstorming for the day.</p><br><br>
												
												<h4>Fact: Everyone has a Genius inside them</h4>
                                                <p>I believe there are many different types of genius whether its dealing with mathematics and numbers, languages, the musical or artistic side of expression, innovation for the future or the ability to connect with the other living species that inhabit Earth. So the question becomes how are we to know if we have really taken account of everyone's ability to think, adapt and attain their true capabilities without even including the external variables of environmental and wisdom through real experiences?</p>

                                                <h4>Recognizing your Genius Mindset = True Value</h4>
                                                <p>If you already know what direction you want your life to go in, in terms of short and long term, then your already half way there. But do you understand the steps you need to achieve them? Imagine outside the lil' box in the membrane for a moment. Will you be the top 1% of the richest people in the world? Do you have the $1,000,000 million dollar Idea  (reached by the age of 24) even in mind yet? Is the 1milliondollar man now worth 100miliion in terms of the growth in wages and some CEOs still earning $40,000 an hour? Picture what will you care about more in like 5, 10, 20 years from now. Have you tested the limits of your mentally and physical abilities outside standardized testing?  Looking at the perspective of not only growing wisdom for oneself but from helping one another and stopping the struggles, stress, and tribulations that we are faced with daily. That's where the complex mind and brain activity can zoom through 150,000 thoughts in one day. How do you retain all this information being shared and learned and what difference does it truly make?</p>

												<h4>Repetition and Recharge</h4>
                                                <p>Personally I believe that my genius comes in the form of keeping my mind fresh by continually learning and doing things that I love, such as dancing, music, sports and now the amazing world of marketing. To share data and performance, to creating visual writting content, connecting with customers through social media and use the artistic data engagement. After the day in and day out of coding this website and finally launching this updated version of my new and official main (global and local connection), the one quote that I have come across that best sums up life is by Louis L’Amour and states ‘The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.’ Life is best described as a roller coaster because it is continuously consisting of high and low points. The key to life is to be content not only during the high but in the low points as well. </p>

                                                <p>So whatever happens keep moving and striving towards your goals, passions, desires and going for your full potential. You are the author of your own life story so why not make it a happy one? Look, I'm just 24, and personally... whether you remember it all, take notes, or write it all down or not, in one way or another your life story is being created and written down for the history books. So start reaching for the limits of a genius, you won't get there overnight, its about repetition and knowing the ability to not over do yourself. No matter what stage in your life that you are in, genuis.</p><br>
